# hello Lua!

This is a simple hello-world module for Lua, intended for learning
about writing modules in C.

It shows how to:

* Make the C module
* Make a basic Makefile to compile it
* Make a rockspec to distribute it with [LuaRocks](http://www.luarocks.org/)
* Make a test program to test it

The test program can be executed as plain Lua, or with [Shake](http://shake.luaforge.net/).
